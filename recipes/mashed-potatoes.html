<h4>Description</h4>
<p>This recipe will hopefully give you the proper techniques to turn out perfect mashed potatoes every time; always light, fluffy and lump-free.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>3 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut in half lengthwise</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place the potatoes into a large pot, and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until 
        tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain, and return the potatoes to the pot. Turn heat to high, and allow the potatoes to dry for about 30 
        seconds. Turn off the heat.

    <li>Mash the potatoes with a potato masher twice around the pot, then add the butter and milk. Continue to mash until smooth and fluffy.
